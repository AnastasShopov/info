# Multiple Applicable Legislations

@@name supports multiple applicable legislations in one ERP instance.

When the business spans multiple countries, different legislations can govern the different aspects of the business.
The feature allows the different managed legal entities to be based on different applicable legislations.

Generally, the legislation is primarily based on the company, managed with the ERP solution.
However, it is possible that sales to foreign clients must follow different rules.

It is also possible that in some cases multiple legislations (federal or EU) apply together with local regulations.
