# Business Intelligence

The ERP.net platform provides both built-in Standard Business Intelligence and means to create custom BI.

## Standard Business Intelligence

The standard BI provides standardized cubes, tailored for standard scenarios.
This has some pros and cons.

The standard BI evolves with each new version of the platform.

The problem is that it might not have the custom view required by some custom tailored business processes.

## Custom Business Intelligence

Custom BI utilizes some external BI tool, like [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/).
Custom BI has access to the data through API and can be used to build custom cubes, KPIs, dashboards and more.

The custom BI can be integrated directly in the system through web views, context filtered by the on-screen data.

For example, when you open a customer definition, you can see a BI information right there, tightly integrated with the other master data.
